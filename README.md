> a custom block to _blockify_ the famous Hello Dolly, plugin

<!-- - WordPress img   - Gutenberg img -->

## Introduction
Gutenblock is a repository made to get-started with custom blocks targeted for the new
WordPress editor, [Gutenberg]. The custom block was developed locally using docker compose. Choosing the [Hello-Dolly] plugin is a great way for beginners to get started with block development. Follow the git commit [history] on how Gutenblock was created.
Share any comments, feedback, or inquires. I always love to hear and learn from the community‚ù§

Learn more about developing custom blocks from the official [documentation].
